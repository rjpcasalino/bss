bss - boring static site generator

+ Getting Started
	VERBOSE=1 will make bss talkative.

	bss reads a manifest.ini for configuration options.

	```
	[build]
	src=src/
	dest=_site/
	templates_dir=templates
	watch=false

	safe=false
	include=
	exclude=*.md
	encoding=utf-8
	markdown_ext=markdown,mkdown,mkdn,mkd,md

	[server]
	port=1988
	host=127.0.0.1

	```
	Please note the lack of quotes in values.

A simple web server is included but one would be wise in using it only for local development purposes.
